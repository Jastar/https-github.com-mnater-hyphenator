= Version Numbers =
You may want to know, how the version numbers are built.
Each version number consists of three numbers separated by a dot:

`A.B.C`

The first number (`A`) denotes the number of the major release. This number is changed if there's a change in the API or an important new feature.

The second number (`B`) denotes the number of a minor release. The numbering begins fom 0, when the major release has changed. A minor release is caused by a new language or an important bugfix.

The third number (`C`) is the bugfix number. The numbering begins from 0, when the minor release number has changed.
