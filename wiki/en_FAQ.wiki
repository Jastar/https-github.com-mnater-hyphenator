== Shouldn't hyphenation be done on the server side? ==
There are some arguments against client side hyphenation - true. It costs a lot of computing time and the patterns have to be loaded for each language, everytime.
But I believe that hyphenation belongs to the client:
  * Only the client «knows» where to break a line (and if at all).
  * A html file that has been hyphenated on the server would be full of &shy;'s. That's ugly and nobody knows how that would be treated by search engines…
  * Hyphenation on the client can be turned off to work around copy&paste- and search-bugs in most browsers.
  * as JavaScript-engines are in focus of development, they become faster and faster.

== Hyphenator breaks the search functionality of my browser ==
Your browser has a bug (currently, only Firefox3 finds hyphenated words). The only thing we can do is to turn hyphenation off before searching.

== When I copy/paste hyphenated texts from a website, spaces are inserted in allmost all words ==
This are not spaces, that's the soft hyphen that Hyphenator inserted (think of 'enriched' text). Most texteditors display the soft hyphen as a space. As far as I know, MS Word handles the soft hyphens correctly.
You can turn off Hyphenation before copying text from a website or you search and replace the softhyphens later.

== Could you write an extension/plugin for … ==
Maybe I could. But
  # to maintain Hyphenator.js is enough for the moment and
  # there are so many CMSs, Blogs and other Frameworks out there, I wouldn't know where to begin.
The coolest thing is, when YOU decide to write a plugin or whatever for your favorite environment, based on Hyphenator.js.
If you need a special feature, send me an e-mail, We'll found a solution.

== Why are the pattern files so different in size? ==
Patterns depend highly on linguistics and grammar of the respective language. Where it seems (I suppose) to be enough for some Indian languages to break a word after some special characters the hyphenation rules for german are quite complex.

== JavaScript is insecure and evil. It should be turned off in every browser! ==
Welcome to Web 2.0, the world of AJAX and modern browsers!
It's true, JavaScript had a very bad reputation - not because JavaScript itself is bad, but because of a very poor implementation in some browsers. As of today JavaScripts influence is growing and browser developers put a lot of work in making their JavaScript engines better, secure and really fast. There are a lot of webpages using JavaScript in a good manner.
Further, Hyphenator.js follows the rules of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unobtrusive_JavaScript *unobtrusive JavaScript*].

== How about Accessibility? ==
Following the rules of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unobtrusive_JavaScript *unobtrusive JavaScript*] Hyphenator.js has AFAIK no influence on accessibility of your webpage. It just adds a feature that will not be missed by a screen reader.
