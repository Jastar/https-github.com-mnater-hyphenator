#How to use Hyphenator on your website

= Using Hyphenator on a website =
You can freely use Hyphenator on your website. Send me a notice about it, if you feel like.
This article explains what you will have to do and gives you some configuration hints.

== Step by Step ==
  #Prepare your HTML-documents by
    * Encoding it in UTF-8.
    * Setting the appropriate lang-attributes (e.g. `<html lang="en">`).
    * Adding `class="hyphenate"` to the elements whose text should be hyphenated (children do inherit this setting).
  # Include the script by adding the following code to your HTML-document:
{{{
<script src="http://www.mnn.ch/hyph/v5/Hyphenator.js"
		type="text/javascript">
</script>
}}} 
    You may also [http://code.google.com/p/hyphenator/downloads/list download it] and load it from your server. If you do that, you will also have to change the hardcoded basepath in the script (somewhere around line 28).
  # Invoke the script, when the page is loaded:
{{{
<script type="text/javascript">
	window.onload=function() {
		Hyphenator.hyphenateDocument();
	};
</script>
}}}
	Done.
	There are some settings you can change before invoking the script:
	To change the minimal length of words to be hyphenated (default=6, the lower the number the slower the script), use this:
{{{
Hyphenator.setMinWordLength(4);
}}}
	To change the hyphen character (defaults to &amp;shy;):
{{{
Hyphenator.setHyphenChar('|');
}}}
	Other settings are hardcoded in the script. Read it, and change them!

When the function `Hyphenator.hyphenateDocument()` is called, the script hyphenates all text of elements having the attribute `class="hyphenate"` â€” even the text of their child-elements.
